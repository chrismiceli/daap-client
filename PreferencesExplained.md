# Introduction #

There are some preferences that can be reached from the home screen.  Not all of them are self explanatory.  We will outline them here.


# SD Card #
This means that while the song is downloading or streaming, it will store the temporary file on the SD Card instead of using the phone's internal memory.  This is good for very large songs, or a phone that doesn't have that much memory available (phones that aren't very high end).

# Streaming (beta) #
This enables streaming.  However, sometimes people may feel that the skip after downloading may be to jarring for their tastes.  This is why it is a preference.  If you are experiencing problems, try disabling this to see if it goes away.  If it does let us know and we'll have an easier time debugging your problem.

# Font Size #
This is to control the font size of the songs/albums/artists displayed in the list.  Some people prefer larger font size because the song names are short.  However, for long file names it makes sense to have a smaller font.  Now we have a preference for it.
